### Prerequisites.
* To get started, ensure you have `Node.js` installed preferably v18+ 
* Adhere to the requirements of each submodule (frontend & backend)

### Installation

#### Clone the Network Status Repository.

First, clone the Shardeum network status repository to your local machine.


```
git clone https://github.com/shardeum/network-status.git
```

#### Install the required dependencies for the frontend and backend:
 For the backend,

 ```bash
 cd backend
 npm i
 ```

This will install all the dependencies required for the backend project (i.e Node.js server)

To start the local development server for the backend project, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the local Node server on port `3002` (or your locally specified port). 

> Your Prometheus server should be running on port 9090  [how to set up Prometheus](https://github.com/shardeum/network-status/tree/main/backend#run-prometheus)
> 
For the frontend project, change directory into the frontend directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm i
```
Start the frontend server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the local development server for the frontend project on port `3000` (or your locally specified port).
